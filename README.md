# Double Pendulum Logo

This simple double pendulum project is based off of the amazing Coding Train tutorial which you can find here (https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/093-double-pendulum.html). I wanted to create a logo for my website and I wanted to learn how to use github pages and so this seemed like the ideal project.
